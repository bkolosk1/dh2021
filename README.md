## Short descritpion
This project addresses the problem of forest fires and the consequences of the environment.
In order to do so we manually constructed dataset of wildfires, described by location features, duration features, how much area was impacted, what were the consequences to the nature.
Furthermore we employ NLP techniques to construct a Knowledge Graph where facts and entities of causes and relations are collected by automatically scraping and analyzing top N google articles, which we later visualize.
To see the impact on a broader scale, we also collect and visualize satellite images before and after the fire disaster and analyze the sentiment of the public throught NLP sentiment analysis.
Finally with the taken parameters we suggest how much reforestation should be done and how big the damage was by some conventional and nonconventional compartment metrics.

## Project organization

- [Knowledge graphs, language analysis](./src/back/nlp)
- [Image acquisition and processing](./src/back/maps)
- [Data](./data) <- Scraped and serialized data 
- [UI/UX Mockup](./mockups)     

## Setup

The backend code is developed with Python 3. To install the dependencies needed for reproduction of results run the following line.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirments.txt
pipenv install
```

## Usage

## Initial data 

The initial data of the wildfires is obtained from the Wikipedia [list of wildfires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wildfires).
Since the table is incomplete and some key information were missing as exact coordinates, number of casualties and the cause of the incident, we have manually collected data as close as possible.
The dataset consists out of set of wildfire incidents, it's exact location, area affected, the cause of the incident, as well as the number of casualties, homes and people evacuated in order to obtain the proportions of such and incident.

## Earth Observation Hack
We use SINERGIZE's satellite imagery with a custom script for visualizing wildfires in order to collect the images before, during and after the incident has occured.
For a given event, we scan the coordinates with a bounding box in order to collect the imagery in the interval of [start_day-10, end_day+30] and obtain a collection of unique satellite images of the specific wildfire.
Additionaly, while acquiring the images, we scan for the satellite data on the available and non-cloudy dates in order to obtain high-quality images.
